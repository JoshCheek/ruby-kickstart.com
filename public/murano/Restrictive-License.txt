This applies to the current directory (murano) and all subdirectories and files
contained within them, except for files which state otherwise within them.

I bought this off of Theme Forest (http://themeforest.net/item/murano-admin/106224)
I do not own it, and as such, it is not under the MIT License that the rest of the
material is under.

It is unclear to me what license it is under or what I should put here, I've contacted
the author to ask, but he hasn't gotten back to me. All private data has been kept
out of the repo, so the only things available are things that must be served publicly
in order to use the theme.

If you use the source of this site for your own project, you will have to either
buy the theme yourself, or remove all of the code contained in this dir.

If I am in any way using this material in a way that violates my rights of the actual
owner (either Theme Forest, or rodcreative.com), then inform me (josh.cheek@gmail.com)
and I will remedy the situation immediately.

Alternatively, if anyone reads this and would like to offer me a design under the
appropriate F/OSS license, I would be very appreciative.
